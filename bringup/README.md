# Bringup

This project was used to bring up a bunch of interfaces in a serial way. Meaning: when something worked, I'd move
on to the next interface without worrying about not breaking previous stuff. 

So it's totally possible that things are entirely broken in the project!

For things that work, have a look at real functional projects such as my 
[Racing the Beam Ray Tracer](https://github.com/tomverbeure/rt) or [Pano Man](https://github.com/skiphansen/pano_man).
